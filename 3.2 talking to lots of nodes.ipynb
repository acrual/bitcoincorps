    "In the first lesson we learned to interpret the outermost layer of the Bitcoin Protocol onion: the [message structure](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#Message_structure). We learned to send a `version` message to Bitcoin Network peers and listen for their `version` response. We learned to read this response and check that the correct `magic` bytes came at the beginning of the message; to interpret which of the 27 `command` types the message is; to read `payload` data associated with the command and the check the payload with a `checksum` given to us by our remote peer;\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second lesson we learned to peel another layer or two of the onion. We learned to read the [payload](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#version) of `version` messages. Along the way we had to figure out how to interpret all the sub-structures of the data, such as variable-length strings\", variable-length integers, network addresses, `services` bitfields, Unix timestamps, and big-endian encoded port numbers.\n",

    "We've come a long way, but we still have a long way to go.\n",

    "Now that we can talk to our peers, let's be friendly neighbors and introduce ourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will connect to the nearl 10,000 Bitcoin Network peers that operate out in the open. We'll send each a `version` message and we'll record for their responses. Our first attempts at this will be far too slow and we will learn about \"concurrent programming\" -- a technique that frees our program to work on many things at once, in our case talking to Bitcoin Network peers.\n",

    "The first thing we did in the first lesson was to pull up [this website](https://bitnodes.earn.com/nodes/) and look for the IP address of some other node to talk to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're going to write some Python code to do this for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "bitnodes.earn.com offers [a free, unauthenticated API](https://bitnodes.earn.com/api/#list-nodes) to help us do this. You've probably heard this word before -- API -- and you probably don't know exactly what it means. The acronym [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) stands for \"Application Programming Interface\". An \"Application Programming Interface\" is a description of how a programmer can interact with a piece of software. For example, Python has an API for converting `bytes` to `int`s: [int.from_bytes(bytes, byteorder, \\*, signed=False)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#int.from_bytes). Python defines this exact function allowing programmers to accomplish this exact operation. There are multiple different \"implementations\" of python -- CPython, PyPy, MicroPython etc -- and they all implement this same API.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's the original meaning of the term \"application programming interface\". But it's most frequently used describe this sort of thing in a specific domain: web programming. Please read this [explainer](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82) of this more narrow definition of the term. The [earn.com API](https://bitnodes.earn.com/api/) is one such example of \"API\" in this sense of the word.\n",
    "\n",
    "The earn.com API is free and also \"unauthenticated\" which means we don't have to present any kind of credential in order to use this -- stock market data APIs, for one, aren't so kind!\n",
    "\n",
    "The API has this specific [List Nodes endpoint](https://bitnodes.earn.com/api/#list-nodes) which will give a list of every node they are aware of at present or some specific point in the past. We are able to specify \n",
    "\n",
    "To \"exercise\" this API we need to send a GET http request. This is the same sort of request that your browser sense every time you load a webpage. It just fetches data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### cURL: A Terminal Utility\n",

    "(If you get any error you probably need to install the cURL program. Google it!)\n",

Our code must not have race conditions, and it must have a central, controlling task manager that can supervise the connections to our peers and assemble valid blockchain. We will spend a lot of time profiling and optimizing our code because initial block download must be as fast as possible.\n",

This would simply involve connecting to a peer, sending them a `getaddr` message, listening for the `addr` response, then doing the verack handshake with each address contained in the `addr` message, and repeat -- taking care to log each version message you receive. Not that bitnodes skips any nodes running versions < 70001. Can you find some nodes with lower version numbers than that?\n",
    "* A related idea to the above idea -- what if you sent `getaddr` messages to every peer that bitnodes gave us, listened for and saved the convents of each peer's `addr` response. Then you see if our peers will tell us about any nodes that bitnodes doesn't includ -- this is probably the best approach to find old nodes.\n",
